###### This repository implements a bunch of reinforcement learning algorithms.

#### packages used
* tensorflow
* numpy
* gym

#### Currently implemented algorithms:
* Double DQN
* Double DQN with dueling network
* REINFORCE with Monte Carlo baseline

#### Note:
The network architecture is quite arbitrary. I made it randomly large so that I can quickly test on different environment.
